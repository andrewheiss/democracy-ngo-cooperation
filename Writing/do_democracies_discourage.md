To do:
* Graphs of 
	* Extension predicted probabilities over governance, separated by democracies and non-democracies + demdur
	* UDS simulation + predicted probabilities
	* regional predicted probabilities

Country-level or regional-level fixed effects are generally controlled for and ignored, like time fixed effects. But in this case, regional fixed effects actually tell an interesting story and explain much of the counterintuitive finding of democracy discouraging cooperation - types of NGOs that work in each region are more/less amenable to cooperation + environments more/less welcoming to cooperation
Restrictions on NGOs
Anecdotes of cooperating NGOs



# Introduction

Find good/bad governance democracy/non-democracy in ME, Asia
Case of NGOs cooperating in each of the 4 types
Can be the introduction, good section of the paper

Lots of cooperation in nondemocratic China; very little in Japan and South Korea
Little in Saudi Arabia, Syria; lots in Israel, Turkey


# Opening the black box of NGO behavior

Prior to Bob, nobody looked at NGOs as organizations - treated them as altruistic actors...

New work on explaining determinants of INGO effectiveness - Wong, Stroup, other Murdie, Carpenter, etc.
Little work has been done on the domestic contexts - where the INGOs work
Murdie:2013 does that - looks at quality of governance and how that impacts inter-NGO cooperation

Cooperation as proxy for effectiveness - type of strategy for building networks

QOG has a significant impact
Puzzlingly, democracy weakens that cooperation


# Institutional proxies for civil society sector strength

Measuring civil society strength systematically is difficult - Johns Hopkins vs. Civicus thing
No data on age of sector, level of trust - WVS, Gallup, but not a lot of data
Same with NGO restrictions - government regulations on NGO funding and activities - that one paper + Bloodgood, Ron, and Prakash at ISA

Trust typically measured by WVS question on trust or Gallup question on wallets, but they don't go back that far. Murdie used quality of governance as a proxy for trust

Instead we can look at democratic institutions themselves, under the assumption that civil society is generally a part of democratic rule (citation needed). We can look at other proxy variables - inequality, wealth, age of democracy

## Hypotheses here

She posits that young NGO sectors are driving the democracy effect. There is no reliable way to measure NGO sector age, though. Indirectly use Knack, who finds income inequality and wealth are strong predictors of trust?

Younger NGO sectors less likely to cooperate

Democracies with less trust are less likely to cooperate

H1: newer democracies less likely to cooperate

H2: lower levels of democracy less likely to cooperate

H3: The location of action has an effect on the likelihood of cooperation - regional effects


# Data and methods

## Dependent variable

## Independent variables

UDS instead of dichotomous
Age of democracy (plus age of authoritarianism for comparison?)
Region


## Modeling decisions

# Results

# Conclusion

Nope. Democracies don't inherently discourage cooperation. Other factors—regional specific ones, quality of governance, etc.—do, but regime type doesn't.

Except maybe in specific regions?
